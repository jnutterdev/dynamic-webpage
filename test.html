    <h1>Curse of the Current Reviews</h1>
    <p>It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York. Don't you think she looks tired? Black tie...Whenever I
        wear this, something bad always happens. You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords. Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't
        ever mistake that for nice.</p>

    <h3>Hello WatchKit</h3>
    <p>Goodbye...my Sarah Jane! I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation.
        And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky. Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice. I don't want to go. I'm Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of
        Balamory.</p>
